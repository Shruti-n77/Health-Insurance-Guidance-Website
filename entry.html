                Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plan: An HMO plan typically requires you to choose a primary care physician (PCP) who will act as your first point of contact for all your health needs. You'll need a referral from your PCP to see specialists or other healthcare providers.</li>

<li>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan: With a PPO plan, you have more flexibility to choose your healthcare providers. You can see any provider within the PPO network, but you'll pay less if you stay within the network.</li>

<li>Point of Service (POS) Plan: A POS plan is similar to an HMO plan in that you choose a PCP who coordinates your care. However, you may have the option to see out-of-network providers, but you'll likely pay more for those services.</li>

<li>Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO) Plan: With an EPO plan, you must use providers within the network to receive coverage. However, you typically don't need a referral to see a specialist.</li>

<li>High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP): A HDHP plan usually has lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles. You'll need to pay a certain amount out-of-pocket before your insurance kicks in.</li>

<li>Catastrophic Health Plan: A catastrophic health plan is designed to cover major medical expenses, such as hospitalization or surgery. These plans typically have low monthly premiums but high deductibles.</li>
